            <h2>A Life in Administration</h2>
            <p>This book, 'Life in Administration,' is an autobiographical translation of Ghazi Al-Gosaibi's work. It covers his life journey starting from his early stages until his appointment as an ambassador to London in 1992. It is considered one of his most prominent works. The author narrates his experiences and his approach to managing the positions he held. He shares some anecdotes, humorous incidents, and obstacles that he encountered. He also extracts some guidance and advice for administrators in general, and specifically for young individuals.</p>
